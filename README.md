# yt-dislike-ext
Chrome extension which replaces Youtube 'Dislike' text with percent of people who don't 'like' the video. 
Not nearly as good as having actual dislikes, but at least it gives an idea of video quality. 

## Steps to use
1. Download or clone the repo
2. Go to [chrome://extensions/] and enable 'developer mode' in top right
3. Press 'Load Unpacked' 
4. Point at the youtube-dislikes folder
5. Done. Either hard reload, or restart chrome for changes to take effect on your tabs.
